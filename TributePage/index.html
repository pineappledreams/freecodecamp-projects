				<p>
					Lennart Georg Meri was born in Tallinn, a son of the Estonian diplomat and later Shakespeare translator Georg
					Meri, and Estonian Swedish mother Alice-Brigitta Engmann. With his family, Lennart left Estonia at an early age
					and studied abroad, in nine different schools and in four different languages.
					However, the family was in Tallinn when Estonia was occupied by the armed forces of the Soviet Union in June 1940.
					In 1941, the Meri family was deported to Siberia along with thousands of other Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians
					sharing the same fate. Heads of the family were separated from their families and shut into concentration camps
					where few survived. At the age of twelve, Lennart Meri worked as a lumberman in Siberia. He also worked as a
					potato peeler and a rafter to support his family. The Meri family survived and found their way back to Estonia
					where Lennart Meri graduated cum laude from the Faculty of History and Languages of the University of Tartu in
					1953 at the age of 24.
					The politics of the Soviet Union did not allow him to work as a historian, so Meri found work as a dramatist in
					the Vanemuine, the oldest theatre of Estonia, and later on as a producer of radio plays in the Estonian
					broadcasting industry. Several of his films were released to great critical acclaim.
					Already as a student, Lennart Meri had been able to earn his living with his writing, after his father had been
					arrested by the Soviet authorities for the third time. With the help of his younger brother who had been forced to
					leave his studies and take a job as a taxi driver, he managed to support their mother and to complete his own
					studies.

			<blockquote>"Traveling is the only passion that doesn't need to feel shy in front of intellect," wrote Meri.</blockquote>

			<article>Meri's best known work is perhaps Hõbevalge, which translates into Silver White and was published in 1976.
				It reconstructs the history of Estonia and the Baltic Sea region. The Estonian language belongs to the Finnic group
				of the Uralic languages and Estonian is closely related to Finnish and distantly related to Hungarian. As in his
				other works, Meri combines documentary sources and scientific research with his imagination. "If geography is
				prose, maps are iconography," Meri writes. Hõbevalge is based on a wide-ranging ancient seafaring sources, and
				carefully unveils the secret of the legendary Ultima Thule. The name was given in classical times to the most
				northerly land, reputedly six days' voyage from Britain. Several alternative places for its location have been
				suggested, among them the Shetland Islands, Iceland, and Norway. According to Meri, it is possible that Thule
				derives from the ancient Estonian folk poetry, which depicts the birth of the Kaali crater lake in Saaremaa.
				After more than twenty years of refusals, the Soviet administration finally gave permission for Lennart Meri to
				travel beyond the Iron Curtain in the late 1970s, and Meri persistently used the opportunities open to him in
				Finland to remind the free world of the existence of Estonia. He established close relationships with politicians,
				journalists and Estonians who had fled from the occupation. He was the first Estonian to publicize abroad the
				protests against the Soviet plan of mining phosphorite in Estonia (known as the Phosphorite War), which would have
				rendered a portion of the country uninhabitable.
				<br><br>

				In Estonia, environmental protests soon grew into a general revolt against Soviet rule: the "Singing Revolution",
				which was led by Estonian intellectuals. Lennart Meri’s speech Do Estonians Have Hope focused on the existential
				problems of the nation and had strong repercussions abroad. In 1988, Meri became a founding member of the Estonian
				Popular Front, which cooperated with its counterparts in Latvia and Lithuania. After the first non-communist-style
				multi-party election in 1990, Meri was appointed to the post of Foreign Minister. As Minister of Foreign Affairs,
				Lennart Meri’s first task was to create the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He developed around him a group of well
				educated young people, many English speaking, in order to establish an open communication channel to the West, and
				at the same time to represent Estonia more widely on the international scene. He participated in the CSCE
				Conferences in Copenhagen, New York, Paris, Berlin and Moscow, and the foundation conference of the Council of the
				Baltic Sea Countries. He also had several meetings with American and European Heads of State and Foreign Ministers,
				and was the first Eastern European guest to give a presentation at NATO Headquarters in Brussels.
				<br><br>

				In 1992, Lennart Meri, together with 9 Baltic Ministers of Foreign Affairs and an EU commissioner, founded the
				Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) and the EuroFaculty.
				<br><br>

				After a brief period as Ambassador of Estonia to Finland, on 6 October 1992 he became the 2nd President of the
				Republic of Estonia. Meri was the candidate of the Pro Patria Union. Although, on the first ballot, Arnold Rüütel,
				a former leading communist and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Estonian SSR, had led with
				42 per cent of the total vote, the final choice for the nomination was made by Parliament, the Riigikogu, which was
				dominated by the Pro Patria Alliance. During the campaign, some of his opponents tried to bring up questions about
				Meri's alleged former links with the KGB. However, these allegations did not harm Meri's reputation and public
				image. Lennart Meri was sworn in as the President on 6 October 1992. On 20 September 1996, he was re-elected for a
				second and final term. </article>

			<article>Lennart Meri was engaged in the work for the human rights of German refugees from Central and Eastern
				Europe and other victims of ethnic cleansing in Europe, and was a member of the jury of the Franz Werfel Human
				Rights Award, which was awarded by the Centre Against Expulsions (Zentrum gegen Vertreibungen). In 1999 he received
				the highest distinction of the Federation of Expellees (Bund der Vertriebenen).
